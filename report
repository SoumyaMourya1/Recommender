# Shopping Recommender System Report

## 1. Introduction
This report presents the design and development of a **Shopping Recommender System** that suggests relevant products to customers based on their past interactions and browsing history. The goal is to enhance the customer experience and increase user engagement by providing personalized recommendations.

## 2. Design Choices
### 2.1 Data Collection
- Gathered product data, customer browsing history, and purchase records.
- Cleaned and preprocessed data to remove inconsistencies.

### 2.2 Recommendation Techniques
- **Collaborative Filtering:** Utilized user-item interaction data to make personalized recommendations.
- **Content-Based Filtering:** Recommended items based on product attributes and customer preferences.
- **Hybrid Models:** Combined collaborative and content-based filtering for improved accuracy.

### 2.3 Model Evaluation
- **Precision and Recall:** Measured relevance of recommended products.
- **F1-score:** Balanced assessment of precision and recall.
- **Mean Average Precision (MAP):** Evaluated overall ranking effectiveness.

## 3. Results
| Model                  | Precision | Recall | F1-score |
|------------------------|-----------|--------|---------|
| Collaborative Filtering | 80.5%    | 78.2%  | 79.3%   |
| Content-Based Filtering| 76.3%    | 74.1%  | 75.2%   |
| **Hybrid Model**       | **85.1%** | **82.7%** | **83.9%** |
