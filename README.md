# Shopping Recommender System - README

## Project Overview
This project aims to develop a **Shopping Recommender System** that suggests relevant products to customers based on their preferences and browsing history. The system leverages various recommendation techniques, such as collaborative filtering, content-based filtering, and hybrid models, to enhance customer experience and increase engagement.

## Features
- **Personalized Product Recommendations**: Provides suggestions based on user preferences and purchase history.
- **Hybrid Recommendation Techniques**: Combines collaborative filtering and content-based filtering for improved accuracy.
- **Performance Evaluation**: Uses precision, recall, and F1-score to assess recommendation effectiveness.

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-repo/shopping-recommender.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd shopping-recommender
   ```
3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage
1. Run the data preprocessing script:
   ```bash
   python preprocess.py
   ```
2. Train the recommendation model:
   ```bash
   python train.py
   ```
3. Generate recommendations:
   ```bash
   python recommend.py --user_id <user_id>
   ```

## Data
- **User purchase history**
- **Product metadata**
- **Browsing behavior logs**

## Model Selection
- **Collaborative Filtering**: Based on user-item interactions.
- **Content-Based Filtering**: Uses product descriptions and features.
- **Hybrid Model**: Combines both approaches for better recommendations.

## Evaluation Metrics
- **Precision**
- **Recall**
- **F1-Score**
- **Mean Average Precision (MAP)**

## Future Enhancements
- Implement deep learning-based recommendation models.
- Integrate real-time recommendations with a web-based interface.
- Optimize hyperparameters for better model performance.
